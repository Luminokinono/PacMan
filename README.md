This project was developed in Java, using the AWT and Swing libraries to build the graphical interface. The goal was to recreate a simplified 2D version of the classic Pac-Man game as part of a practical programming assignment. It was designed to reinforce object-oriented programming concepts, GUI handling, and basic game mechanics such as movement, collision detection, and game state management. The project is structured progressively, encouraging creativity and the addition of personalized features beyond the basic game logic.
